                    <p>
                        This was about the box model.
                        <br>
                        I had to create three boxes using the box model. I was shown how the final product should end up looking, but without being shown the HTML and CSS, and therefore having to write it myself.
                        This meant trying out many different CSS-properties, until the elements looked identical to the ones shown in the beginning.

                        The photo is only showing a bit of the project.
