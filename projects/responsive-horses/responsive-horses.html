                    <p>
                        This was about responsive web-design.
                        <br>
                        I was shown how the final product should end up looking, but without being shown the HTML and CSS, and therefore having to write it myself.
                        Before making the project, it was made clear that I had to do the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Make it responsive
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use float on the images
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The photo is only showing a bit of the project.
                        <br>

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="about right">
                    <img src="../../img/responsive-horses.png" alt="photo of project">
