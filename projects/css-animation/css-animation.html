                    <p>
                        This was about CSS animations.
                        <br>
                        I had to make an animation of a box moving in the path of a square,
                        while another box was moving in the opposite direction, purely using CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The photo is only showing a bit of the project.
                        <br>
